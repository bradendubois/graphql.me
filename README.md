My personal resume, as an avant-garde [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/).

## Summary

- This GraphQL API is built with the [reference implementation](https://github.com/graphql/graphql-js) of [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/).
- The [schema](https://graphql.org/learn/schema/) can be found [here](./graphql/schema.js).
- Currently, there is no database (as it seems unnecessary for such small data), and instead is stored [here](./graphql/data).
- A [GraphiQL](https://github.com/graphql/graphiql/tree/main/packages/graphiql#readme) interface is accessible at [api.bradendubois.dev](https://api.bradendubois.dev/).
- Queries can also be made directly to [api.bradendubois.dev/api/graphql](http://api.bradendubois.dev/api/graphql).
- This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project, hosted on [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/),the creators of Next.js.

## Start

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to see the GraphiQL IDE.
